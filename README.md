## Library Management System

### Overview
The Library Event Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage various events hosted by libraries. The system leverages design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficient resource management. It supports fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing library events stored in a MySQL database.

### Features
- **Event Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete library events.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes Factory Method for creating event objects and Singleton for managing database connections and logging.
- **Database Integration**: Interacts with a MySQL database for persistent storage of event data.
- **Logging**: Provides robust logging for tracking application behavior and errors.

### Technologies Used
- Java
- MySQL
- JDBC
- Design Patterns: Factory Method, Singleton, DAO, DTO
- Maven (for dependency management)
- JUnit (for unit testing)
